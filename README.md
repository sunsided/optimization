# (Nonlinear) Optimization Library

This library aims to implement different mathematical optimization algorithms, such as regular and conjugate gradient descent. Mathematics is backed by [Math.NET Numerics](https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-numerics).

## Gradient Descent Algorithms

* Resilient Error Gradient Descent

## Conjugate Gradient Descent Algorithms

* Hager-Zhang ("CG_DESCENT")
* Polak-Ribi√®re (supporting preconditioning)
* Fletcher-Reeves

## Line Search Algorithms

- Secant
- Hager-Zhang with quadratic stepping

## Cost Functions

* Residual Sum of Squares
